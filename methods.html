    <h1>Method</h1>
      <p>Properties that contain functions are generally called 'methods' of the value they belong to, as in “toUpperCase is a method of a string” <br>
         Every string has a toUpperCase property. When called, it will return a copy of the string in which all letters have been converted to uppercase. There is also toLowerCase, going the other way. <br>
         The push method adds values to the end of an array, and the pop method does the opposite, removing the last value in the array and returning it.These names are the traditional terms for operations <br>
         on a stack. A stack, in programming, is a data structure that allows you to push values into it and pop them out again in the opposite order so that the thing that was added last is removed first. <br>
         These are common in programming—you might remember the function call stack from the which is aninstance of the same idea.</p>

        let doh = "Doh";
        console.log(typeof doh.toUpperCase);

        console.log(doh.toUpperCase());

        sequence.push(4);
        sequence.push(5);
        console.log(sequence);
        // → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(sequence.pop());
        // → 5
        console.log(sequence);
        // → [1, 2, 3, 4]
