    <h1>Method</h1>
    <p>Properties that contain functions are generally called 'methods' of the value they belong to, as in “toUpperCase is a method of a string” <br>
        Every string has a toUpperCase property. When called, it will return a copy of the string in which all letters have been converted to uppercase. There is also toLowerCase, going the other way. </p>
    <script>
        let doh = "Doh";
        console.log(typeof doh.toUpperCase);
        // → function
        console.log(doh.toUpperCase());
        // → DOH

        let sequence = [1, 2, 3];
        sequence.push(4);
        sequence.push(5);
        console.log(sequence);
        // → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(sequence.pop());
        // → 5
        console.log(sequence);
        // → [1, 2, 3, 4]
