    <h1>The call stack</h1>
    <p>A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.</p>
     <ul>
       <li>When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.</li>
       <li>Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.</li>
       <li>When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing</li>
       <li>If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.</li>
    </ul>
<script>
        function greet(who) {
        console.log("Hello " + who);
        }
        greet("Harry");
        console.log("Bye");
    </script>
