    <h1>Conditional Execution</h1>
    <p>We may, for example, want to create a branching road, where the program takes the proper branch based on the situation at hand. This is called conditional execution.</p>
    <p>Conditional execution is created with the if keyword in JavaScript.We might, for example, want to show the square of the input only if the input is actually a number.</p>
    <p>You often wonâ€™t just have code that executes when a condition holds true,but also code that handles the other case. You can use the else keyword, together with if, to create two separate, alternative execution paths.</p>
    
    <script>
        let theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number"));
        if (!Number.isNaN(theNumber)) {
        console.log("Your number is the square root of " +theNumber * theNumber);
        } else {
        console.log("Hey. Why didn't you give me a number?");
        }
