            <h1>Strings</h1>
            <img src="./images/string.png" width="300" height="200">
            <p>. Strings are used to represent text. They are written by enclosing their content in quotes.`Down on the sea`</p>
            <p>You can use single quotes, double quotes, or backticks to mark strings, as long as the quotes at the start and the end of the string match.</p>
            <p> A quote that is preceded by a backslash will not end the string but be part of it. When an n character occurs after a backslash, it is interpreted as a newline. Similarly, a t after a backslash means a tab character.</p>
            <p> Strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted, but the + operator can be used on them. It does not add, but it concatenates—it glues two strings together. The following line will produce the string "concatenate""con" + "cat" + "e" + "nate"</p>
            <p>When you write something inside ${} in a template literal, its result will be computed, converted to a string, and included at that position. The example produces “half of 100 is 50”.</p>

       <script>
            console.log ("This is the first line\nAnd this is the second");
            console.log ("A newline character is written like \"\\n\".");
            console.log ("con" + "cat" + "e" + "nate");
            console.log(`half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`);
