        <h1>Strings</h1>
        <p>A JavaScript string stores a series of characters like "John Doe". A string can be any text inside double or single quotes var carName1 = "Volvo XC60"; var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60'; String indexes are zero-based: The first character is in position 0, the second in 1, and so on.        </p>

        <script>
            console.log ("This is the first line\nAnd this is the second");
            console.log ("A newline character is written like \"\\n\".");
            console.log ("con" + "cat" + "e" + "nate");
            console.log(`half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`);
