    <h1>JS Switch Statement </h1>
    <p>The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.</p>
    <ul>
        This is how it works:

        <li> The switch expression is evaluated once.</li>
        <li> The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.;</li>
        <li> If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.</li>
        <li>If there is no match, the default code block is executed.</li>    
    </ul>
    <script>
        switch (prompt("What is the weather like?")) {
        case "rainy":
        console.log("Remember to bring an umbrella.");
        break;
        case "sunny":
        console.log("Dress lightly.");
        case "cloudy":
        console.log("Go outside.");
        break;
        default:
        console.log("Unknown weather type!");
        break;
        }
    </script>
