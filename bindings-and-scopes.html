    <p>Each binding has a scope, which is the part of the program in which the binding is visible. For bindings defined outside of any function or block, the scope is the whole program <br>
        you can refer to such bindings wherever you want. These are called global.</p>
   <p>Bindings declared with let and const are in fact local to the block that theyare declared in, so if you create one of those inside of a loop,the code before and after the loop cannot <br>
     “see” it.In pre-2015 JavaScript, only functions created new scopes, so old-style bindings,created with the var keyword, are visible throughout the whole function that they appear  <br> 
     in—or throughout the global scope, if they are not in a function.</p>
    <script>    
     let x = 10;
     if (true) {
     let y = 20;var z = 30;
     console.log(x + y + z);
     // → 60
     }
     // y is not visible here
     console.log(x + z);
     // → 40
     const halve = function(n) {
     return n / 2;
     };
     let n = 10;
     console.log(halve(100));
     // → 50
     console.log(n);
     // → 10
