    <h1>FizzBuzz</h1>
    <p>Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100,with two exceptions. 
        For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
       When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).</p>  
<script>
    for (let n = 1; n <= 100; n++) {let output = "";
    if (n % 3 == 0) output += "Fizz";
    if (n % 5 == 0) output += "Buzz";
    console.log(output || n);
    }
</script>
