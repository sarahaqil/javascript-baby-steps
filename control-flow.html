    <h1>Control Flow</h1>
    <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.</p>
    <script>
        let theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number"));
        console.log("Your number is the square root of " +theNumber * theNumber);
    </script>
