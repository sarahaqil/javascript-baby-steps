    <h1>Logical operators</h1>
    <p>Logical operators are mainly used to control program flow. Usually, you will find them as part of an if, a while, or some other control statement </p>
    <p>The Logical operators are:</p>
    <li> <strong>op1 && op2</strong>- Performs a logical AND of the two operands. </li>
    <li> <strong> op1 || op2 </strong> -- Performs a logical OR of the two operands</li>
    <li> <strong>!op1</strong>-- Performs a logical NOT of the operand. </li>
    <p>The concept of logical operators is simple. They allow a program to make a decision based on multiple conditions. Each operand is considered a condition that can be evaluated to a true or false value. Then the value of the conditions is used to determine the overall value of the op1 operator op2 or !op1 grouping.</p>

    <script>
        console.log(true && false)
        //→ false
        console.log(true && false)
        //→ true
        console.log(false || true)
        // → true
        console.log(false || false)
       // → false
       console.log (1 + 1 == 2 && 10 * 10 > 50);
       console.log(true ? 1: 2);
       // → 1
       console.log(false ? 1 : 2);
       // → 2
