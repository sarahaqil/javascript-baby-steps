  <h1>What is javascript?</h1> 
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <P>JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the
    Netscape Navigator browser. The language has since been adopted by all other
    major graphical web browsers. It has made modern web applications possible—
    applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload
    for every action. JavaScript is also used in more traditional websites to provide
    various forms of interactivity and cleverness.</P> 
    <h3>Versions</h3>
    <p>There have been several versions of JavaScript. ECMAScript version 3 was
        the widely supported version in the time of JavaScript’s ascent to dominance,
        roughly between 2000 and 2010. During this time, work was underway on
        an ambitious version 4, which planned a number of radical improvements and
        extensions to the language. Changing a living, widely used language in such
        aradical way turned out to be politically difficult, and work on the version 4 was
        abandoned in 2008, leading to a much less ambitious version 5, which made
        only some uncontroversial improvements, coming out in 2009. Then in 2015
        version 6 came out, a major update that included some of the ideas planned
        for version 4. Since then we’ve had new, small updates every year.</p>
