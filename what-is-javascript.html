  <h1>What is javascript?</h1> 
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <P>JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the
    Netscape Navigator browser.It has made modern web applications possible—
    applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload
    for every action. JavaScript is also used in more traditional websites to provide
    various forms of interactivity and cleverness.</P> 
    <h3>Versions</h3>
    <p>There have been several versions of JavaScript. ECMAScript version 3 was
        the widely supported version in the time of JavaScript’s ascent to dominance,
        roughly between 2000 and 2010. During this time, work was underway on
        an ambitious version 4, which planned a number of radical improvements and
        extensions to the language.</p>
